# Canvas Workshop

Hello!  
Welcome to the Canvas workshop to learn how to draw anything you want !

## Activities

We propose you different projects :

- Draw a title with 4 squares of different colors (drawing with fill () but also with stroke ()), and adding an image to the center of your canvas. Draw also a canvas border.
- Draw 3 triangles, one with its unclosed path.
- Draw a Pacman

## Explanation

Use the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Tutoriel_canvas/Formes_g%C3%A9om%C3%A9triques), it is very well done :)

### Draw with canvas

To draw in canvas, you must first create a sheet **index.html** and a **script.js** sheet, you can also add a sheet **style.css** if you want to stylize a little more your drawing.

In your index.html, you need to add a canvas tag :

```
<canvas id="canevas" width="600" height="400">You can add text if the canvas is not supported</canvas>

```
